# easy-ragdoll
A lightweight module that provides a seamless way to toggle physics-based ragdoll effects on Roblox characters by dynamically swapping Motor6D joints for BallSocketConstraints. It includes built-in support for both server and client execution, automated joint cleanup, and optional impulse physics for realistic "push" effects.
